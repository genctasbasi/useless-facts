## Technologies and libraries used:
- Simple but proper MVVM architecture
- Dependency injection (DI) with Koin
- Lifecycle aware components and live data to pass results to UI
- Some best practice patterns: Repository pattern, singleton view models
- Single activity app
- Idiomatic and readable code with stateless Jetpack compose components 

## Libraries
- Jetpack compose
- LiveData & coroutines
- Koin
- Retrofit, OkHttp and interceptors
